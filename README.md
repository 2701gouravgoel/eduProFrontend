# EduPro
education is ever evolving process and times like this requires adaptive learning to be introduced to students. Our team came up with an idea to take advantage even in times of crisis because that's what engineers do, So we are making a webapp which will have all of your school/college essentials in one place like you will join as a student and enter your classroom where you will have your whole class joined in virtually along with respective faculty. You can do all sorts of things like having discussion in ask forum, teachers may provide links for classes or any relevant material , you will also have a feature to add notes or some sort of to do list. basically it is a helpful webapp for student to enhance learning. Even when everything is back to offline it will act as virtual backpack for students. further features may be developed in the app
